# Privacy Notice

This privacy notice for mavnn di Michael Joshua Newton ("**we**", "**us**") describes how we may collect or process your information while you are using VisualInk hosted at [https://visualink.mavnn.eu](https://visualink.mavnn.eu) ("**the site**").

## Key points

**What personal information do you process?** Your name and email address (optional unless logging in via a 3rd party identity provider such as Google). If you pay for our service the personal information provided specifically for the purposes of identifying the payment made via our payment processor. Of that information, we do not retain your name and by design we act on no other personal information about individual users. As the service allows users to create content, users may choose to enter and make publicly available personal information via the service, but we will not process that information in any way beyond displaying it as explicitly requested by them publishing it.

**What do we use your personal information for?** To allow you to log in to the website as a specific, known, user and to check if you have made any payments to us and what for.

**In what situations do you share personal information?** If you use an external service such as Google to sign in, they will be aware that you have consented for VisualInk to view your email address and name and that therefore you are presumably a user of our service. If you make a payment to us, the payment processor will need your personal information to process the payment and will be aware that you are making a payment to us. We do not share information with analytics or advertising companies.

**How do we keep information safe?** Primarily by not storing it! We protect access to individual accounts via industry standard security protocols (passwords stored as hashes, up to date servers, etc) but our main protection is that we do not store your private information in the first place.

**What are your rights?** This will depend on where you live, but the site is hosted in the EU which means that we operate under GDPR. This means that may make a data subject request to us regarding information we hold about you at michael@mavnn.eu and we will respond in a timely manner. In general we will also delete any personal data we hold about you on request, although this will prevent you from accessing the site - as we only hold the data to allow that in the first place.

**On what legal basis are you processing my personal data?** The GDPR requires us to explain the specific legal basis we rely on to process your personal information. When you create an account, we rely on your consent, as the only personal data we hold about you is supplied by the user via a clearly labeled sign up form (or external identity service consent form) and is used only to allow access to the service that you are choosing to sign up for and nothing else. If you make a payment to us for our services, we rely on the fact that the additional information you supply is required for the performance of a contract.
